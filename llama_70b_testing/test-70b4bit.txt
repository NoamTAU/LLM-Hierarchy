Wells Cathedral is an Anglican place of XXXX in Wells, Somerset, dedicated to XXXX the Apostle. It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, whose cathedra it holds as mother XXXX of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Built as a XXXX Catholic cathedral from around 1175 to replace an earlier XXXX on the site since 705, it became an Anglican XXXX when Henry VIII split from Rome. Its Gothic architecture is mostly inspired from Early English style of the late 12th to early 13th centuries. The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted piers bears pronounced mouldings and carved capitals in a foliate,'stiff-leaf' style. The east end retains much ancient stained glass. Unlike many cathedrals of monastic foundation, Wells has many surviving secular buildings linked to its chapter of secular canons, including the Bishop's Palace and the 15th-century residential Vicars' Close. The cathedral's XXXX library contains a large collection of ancient manuscripts and printed books.
